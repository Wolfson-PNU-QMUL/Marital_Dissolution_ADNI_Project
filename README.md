# Marital_Dissolution_ADNI_Project

This repository provides all of code using The R Project for Statistical Computing for our project examining the mediating effect of β-amyloid neuropathology on the relationship between marital dissolution and cognition using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Database (ADNI). All database construction and curation and analyses were performed using R software version 4.2.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing). We also used Queen Mary's Apocrita HPC facility, supported by QMUL Research-IT. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.438045 andOpen OnDemand to conduct this project. 

# Code

The code for our entire project is included in this repository. This includes the database construction process, which wrangles, cleans, curates, merges, and filters select raw data files from ADNI including those for amyloid PET, diagnosis, demographics, and cognition. Additionally, we have included all data preparation steps, statistical analyses including primary ones and follow-up-sensitivity analyses, in addition to figure generation and descriptive statistics. 

There are 2 files that contain all of this information:

MaritalDissolutionDatabaseConstruction.R

MaritalDissolutionAnalysis.R
